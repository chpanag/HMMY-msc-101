# Scenario

We have a wind sensor which depends on wind value so that we know to go for windsurfing or not. 
 
# Sensor states for different wind values.

* normal, means no windsurfing due to no wind if wind value [0,2]
* warn, means go windsurfing if wind value [3,6]
* danger, means no windsurfing due to strong wind if wind value >6

Reference wind values (Beaufort scale):

* 0: calm
* 1: light air
* 2: light breeze
* 3: gentle breeze
* 4: moderate breeze
* 5: fresh breeze
* 6: strong breeze
* 7: gale
