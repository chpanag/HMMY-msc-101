The need to monitor a person's temperature is crusial during COVID-19 days.
In our system we try to monitor the body temperature of a person and extract useful
information about the state of health.
A special body temperature sensor (MQTT Broker in our case) sends temperature values
and special events are created.
Our system could be used in metropolitan hospitals, with the intention to aleviate the 
problem of constant temperature monitor of patients, keeping the medical staff away from 
other patients who are in greater need.

The body norms we use:
NORMAL TEMP: 36.1 oC - 37.2 oC
LOW temp: 35.2 oc - 36.2 oC
High Temp: 37.3 oC - 39.8 oc
VERY high temp: 40 oC -42 oC

special events are generated in case of false indications.
